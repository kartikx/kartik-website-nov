        <h1>Kartik's MSCS Statement of Purpose Guide</h1>
        <p>
            The Statement of Purpose is the single, most important piece of the grad school admission process that is
            entirely in your control.
            By the time you come around to writing your first SoP draft, your GPA has been set in stone, your research
            projects are completed,
            and your GRE scores have been sent to most universities. Since the SoP is still in your control, it has the
            potential to make or break your admissions. You should take this <b>very</b> seriously.
            <br />
            Personally, I spent around 3 months, from October - December 2023, on my SoP. I believe it had a significant
            role in getting admissions from multiple, top-10 Computer Science schools, since I don’t have significant
            research experience.
            <br />
            In this post, I will focus on how to craft a compelling Statement out of your life experiences. Articulating
            these ideas into a coherent structure would be a whole other post, but I have left helpful resources down
            <a href="#resources">below</a>.
        </p>
        <h2>Step I: Introspect</h2>
        You have decided to take a massive step in your life, and are likely going to be leaving at least one of your
        family, friends and job behind to take up the arduous task that is grad school. If you haven’t
        already, I want you to ask yourself,

        <div class="quote">Is this the right decision for my larger goals in life?</div>

        Spend around an hour meditating on this. You will notice that it surfaces a lot more questions:

        <ol>
            <li>What do I want to do in life?</li>
            <li>What am I looking to get out of grad school?</li>
            <li>What other alternatives do I have?</li>
        </ol>

        The reason you want to do this is because your SoP must convince the admission committee that you are a great
        fit for their program. However, you can’t do this until you convince yourself. Do <b>you</b> truly believe that
        this is the right step for you?
        <br>

        As you do this, also try to gain some clarity about <i>what</i> you want to study within the larger field of
        Computer
        Science. It’s completely alright to switch later on, your new experiences in grad school might change your
        interests, just try to make a best effort for now.

        <h2>Step 2: Draft your autobiography</h2>

        Now that you are aware about your decisions to pursue grad school, I want you to further introspect and write
        down every single experience, academic or non-academic, that has led you to this decision. For brevity, I want
        you to limit yourself towards the final years of high school, your undergraduate years, and your work
        experience.

        Within your chosen time horizon, I want to emphasize that you write <b>every single experience</b>. As you do
        so, also think about:

        <ol>
            <li>What was the work you did?</li>
            <li>Why did you do it?</li>
            <li>How did it impact you?</li>
            <li>How did it impact other people?</li>
            <li>Your general state of mind during that time.</li>
        </ol>

        It is crucial that you do not skimp out as you do this. You might not know it yet, but that one YouTube video
        you watched 3 years back might be the reason you’re incredibly interested in a particular niche of Computer
        Science. If you can recall bits of information like this from your past, it will add authenticity to your essay.

        Here’s a few example events that I dug up from my list,

        <div class="quote">
            <b>2019 (First year of undergrad)</b><br>
            4. During these years I didn’t really know “How to Learn”, even though I was scoring immensely well. I
            didn’t
            have a clear purpose, I was studying because I was told to. I didn’t want to study more, I enjoyed
            programming.

            <br><br><b>2020 (Second year, Pandemic)</b><br>
            6. Utilized Covid Time to watch a lot of Andrew Ng Deep Learning videos. Astonished when I realized he was
            actually a co-founder of Coursera.

            <br><br><b>2021 (Third year, Pandemic)</b><br>
            4. SWE Internship @ Azure Networking Microsoft to simplify configurations on routers. First Big Tech
            exposure, I was hungry to prove my worth. I used to overwork like crazy, ended up being one of the only
            people
            who got a full time offer without any interview rounds. My director and I ended up chatting about
            Distributed
            Systems and whether AI could take up Systems jobs. Came out to be quite prophetic with OpenAI, as I decided
            on
            pursuing the very same area.<br>
            7. Covid Part 2 → Newfound interest in Distributed Systems. I played around with ML last year, but I felt
            like
            it wasn’t “real programming”. I instead wanted to write code to difficult problems. However, as my project
            and
            Work Ex ended up revealing the two often go hand-in-hand.
        </div>
        Notice that I’m not restricting myself to enumerating “impressive” things. Projects or events that seem
        insignificant in isolation might make the difference in the right context, so list down anything and everything
        that sticks out in your memory. Seeing all these life events together will help you group them to make a
        stronger impact once you start drafting.

        <h2>Step 3: Write your first draft</h2>
        Once I had enumerated my experiences, I started to notice a clear story bloom. If you have formatted your list
        of experiences well, you might as well drop it into ChatGPT and have it write a draft for you.
        <br>
        While this can be a good start, I don’t recommend excessive usage of generative AI. Based on my experience,
        ChatGPT tends to use
        <i>excessively ornamental verbiage</i>, which can be quite easy to spot as a reviewer.
        <br>
        Use the <a href="#resources">list of resources</a> to gain an idea of what a good Statement of Purpose should
        contain. These pointers will help you construct a good draft out of your ideas. There are a lot more helpful
        resources available
        online,
        Reddit and GradCafe are some that you could look into.
        <br>
        I do not recommend reading other people’s statement’s at this step because it could bias you towards writing
        like them and steal away from your authenticity. You can do that after you have made a solid attempt at a first
        draft.
        <br>
        Do not take any longer than 2 weeks at this step, because your first draft is likely going to be incomplete.
        Let’s fix this in the next step.

        <h2>Step 4: Get Peer Reviewed</h2>
        Ideally, this is the step that you want to iterate fastest to, while still having made your best effort towards
        writing a draft. Your reviewers should be people who have applied to graduate school, and preferably
        reviewed multiple statements. Your best bet are people who you know personally, such as your college peers, or
        your seniors. <br />

        Cold approaches on LinkedIn might are also a good approach. I reached out to multiple people who were studying
        at the colleges I was applying to, asking them for advice and a request to review my statement. Not all of them
        responded, and not all of the ones that did reviewed my Statement. However, I did get a few really helpful
        connections who I am still in touch with today. So reach out early with a polite request, and
        respect their time because we are all busy :') <br />

        Reviewing statements takes time, and leaving critical comments takes even more time. So if someone leaves a lot
        of scathing comments on your draft, try not to feel sad. Thank your reviewer, because it’s a strong indicator
        that they spent a lot of time reading your draft. Your draft is about to get a lot better. <br />

        <h2>Step 5: Go back to the drawing board</h2>
        Now, I want you to read other people’s Statements. You can read mine
        <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O5AsgHr_GlnzFyjKi4bPbIWLnqf1XO10/view?usp=drive_link">here</a>. Here
        is
        another really helpful site that contains <a
            href="https://www.notion.so/df39955313834889b7ac5411c37b958d?pvs=21" target="_blank">CS PhD Statements</a>.
        <br />Some of the PhD statements might
        seem a lot more impressive than yours, but that is okay since these people are going to have a lot more
        experience than you.
        <br />
        Try to find people who are applying to similar colleges or CS areas as you. As you read through their
        statements, I want you to analyze how they structure their sentences, how they format their document, and how
        they present their ideas. In a good statement of purpose, every line should have a purpose and should
        communicate something of substance to the reviewer. Take notes and steal good lines if you have to.
        <br />
        If you have time, I recommend repeating steps 4 and 5 a few times until you are satisfied with your statement.
