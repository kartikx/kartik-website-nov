        <h1>Hugging Face Agent AI Internship</h1>
        Hi Hugging Face! ðŸ¤—
        <br>
        I'm Kartik, a Master's in Computer Science student at University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign where I am
        researching multi-agent systems, distributed systems and machine learning. I am really excited by the
        opportunity to work at Hugging Face and contribute towards democratizing good AI.
        <br>
        I have a strong background in ML, Systems and Open Source. I believe I can contribute
        towards the Hugging Face mission, and in this post I would like to convince you why.
        <h2>Multi-Agent Website Cloner</h2>
        Multi-Agent systems fascinate me. I am particularly interested in leveraging their
        collaborative potential to model complex tasks. To explore this, I developed a
        multi-agent system to clone websites. I used the open-source multi-agent framework <a
            href="https://ag2ai.github.io/ag2/">AutoGen</a> to build this.
        <br />
        The system comprises of 3 agents:
        <ol>
            <li>Coder: Writes the code to clone a website.</li>
            <li>Evaluator: Evaluates the coder's attempts and provides feedback.</li>
            <li>Screenshotter: Takes screenshots of the target and cloned website.</li>
        </ol>
        Since multi-agent systems allow fine-grained LLMs that can interact with each other iteratively, they are a
        lot more accurate at solving complex problems than single agent systems. However, this benefit comes at the cost
        of increase code complexity with each added agent, as well as a non-determinism due to the nature of LLMs.
        <br />
        There is a clear need for a stable, open-source, computer-use framework that can allow everyone to build
        and deploy multi-agent systems. I would love to contribute towards this goal at Hugging Face.

        <h2>Model Sharding for LLM Pre-Training</h2>
        I am also motivated by the urgency to democratize training large ML models. LLMs promise revolutionary
        capabilities, however only a handful of big tech players can train them today. I am inspired by the current work
        that <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/bloom-megatron-deepspeed">Hugging Face is doing in this space.</a>
        <br />
        To explore this area, I evaluated several distributed training strategies, such as Data Parallelism, Tensor
        Parallelism and Pipeline Parallelism using <a href="https://www.deepspeed.ai/">DeepSpeed</a> to train GPT-2 on
        heterogenous GPUs.
        <br />
        Based on these experiments, our team found that optimizing for Data Parallelism is the most efficient. We
        used this observation to develop an algorithm to search effective model sharding strategies on heterogenous
        device clusters, reducing search time by 15% compared to the state-of-the-art.
        <br />
        You can find the code <a href="https://github.com/kartikx/Metis">here</a>.
        <h2>Open Source contributions</h2>
        I am a strong advocate for open-source software, and I have contributed to several projects, including
        <a href="https://www.digikam.org/">DigiKam</a>, an open-source photo management software and, more recently, <a
            href="https://github.com/ag2ai/ag2/pulls?q=is:pr+author:kartikx+is:closed">AutoGen</a>.
        <br />
        At DigiKam, I contributed over 3000 lines of C++ code to improve the performance of the facial recognition
        algorithm, and patched 10+ open issues to improve application stability and user experience.
        <br />
        I wrote about this experience <a href="https://community.kde.org/GSoC/2020/StatusReports/KartikRamesh">here</a>.
        <h2>Distributed Systems experience</h2>
        My biggest strength is my systems engineering skills. Prior to joining University of Illinois, I was a software
        engineer in the Azure Networking team at Microsoft.<br />
        I developed a distributed network troubleshooting service to process gigabytes of daily telemetry
        across 10,000+ routers, reducing incident resolution time by 30%. To do this at scale, I architected an
        event-driven microservices pipeline using serverless functions and messaging queues. I also designed an
        interactive React web application for collaborating incident troubleshooting and telemetry visualization.
        <br />
        More recently, I have been developing distributed systems in Go. I developed a
        <a href="https://github.com/kartikx/distributed-file-system">fault-tolerant distributed file system</a>
        supporting file operations with high availability and eventual consistency. To maintain fault tolerance,
        I developed a membership protocol, which detects node failures under 5 seconds and ensures 3x replication
        at all times for all files.
        <h2>Why should you give me a chance?</h2>
        I believe that my academic and professional experiences in ML and Systems can be a great asset to Hugging Face.
        Furthermore, I work really hard, love pushing myself and believe I have a lot of potential. <br />
        I believe that the work that Hugging Face is doing is important, and I want to be a part of it. I want to
        surround myself with people that care about democratizing AI. <br />
        Please give me a shot, I won't let you down.<br />
